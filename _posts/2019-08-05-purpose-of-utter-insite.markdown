The purpose of the blog is purely a selfish one. There is a lot of cool knowledge out there that I would like to attain. This blog will be used as a tool for me to try to make sure that I understand what I have learned. It will also be used as good record of some of the skills I manage to pick up as well as a cheatsheet when needed. This is the first of what I'm sure will be a very random set of posts on topics that interest me.
